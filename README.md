# Welcome to the 'ML Model Backup' repository!
This repository contains code that allows you to backup your machine learning models and intermediate results to AWS S3 in a pay-as-you-go fashion. This is a cost-effective solution that allows you to store your data without having to worry about upfront costs or capacity planning.

One of the key benefits of this approach is that it supports unlimited concurrent users. This means that you can share your models and results with your team or colleagues without having to worry about capacity constraints.

Overall, this repository is a useful tool for anyone looking to store their machine learning models and results in a secure, scalable, and cost-effective way. Whether you are a researcher, data scientist, or machine learning engineer, this repository has something to offer you. So feel free to browse the code, give it a try, and let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions!


To run, just update the path you would like to backup in the awsS3Dropbox.py and run under screen command the following:
